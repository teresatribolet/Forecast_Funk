<h1>What is Forecast Funk?</h1>
<p>Forecast Funk was designed to curate a handpicked Spotify playlist of our favorite tunes to help users get through the day, rain or shine! We utilized a weather API and combined this with embeddable content from Spotify. We built the logic using IF and IF ELSE statements to determine which specific playlist should be embeded to the page for each set of temperatures and conditions!</p>
<p>This is a project born from the Tech Talent South class in Asheville, North Carolina. This was dreamed up, coded and designed by Teresa Tribolet and Megan Bell.</p>
